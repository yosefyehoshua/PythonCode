================

This is it! the exercise we’ve all been waiting for students, teachers,
tsars, and of course, you.
in this ex the assignment was to program a social drawing board, a program
that helps you share your paintings and even paint one with your friend online.
to make it possible we've built 4 classes:

class DrawingBoard:
this class will manage the builtin GUI we work with
class Shape:
a more passive class, to make the shapes we're drawing
simpler and easy to read, this class is merely composed of getters.
class Client:
this class will represent a client in this program, it will basically manage
all the communication with the server by sending & receiving massages
to and from it. Also, it will contain the personal GUI of each user.

class AppManager:
this class is in charge of managing the operation of the drawing board,
initiating the communication with the server, the GUI and binding events.

Input Validation:
We've chosen to check to validity of the user's input before initiating the
GUI. In our view, this prevents a future problems and simplifies the code,
even though the 'server.py' code contains similar input tests.

Images:
We're using 4 images for the buttons:
line.png
triangle.png
rectangle.png
oval.png
(these files are included in the submission)
